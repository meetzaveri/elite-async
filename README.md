# mimicing-async
With pure vanilla JS, I have been able to develop caolan's async library's some of the most used collections or control flow methods. It is not that sophisticated as caolan's async, but I have managed to scrape out core functionalities of respective collections/control-flow methods.I am looking to improve this repo by adding new methods especially using ES6's Async/await utility

## Collections/ Control-Flow methods to have
- [X] Parallel
- [X] Every
- [X] Waterfall
- [ ] Each
- [ ] ReduceRight

## want to contribute
- Take out pull from development branch

## Inspiration
I know callbacks were the wizards behind this, I just need to figure out what's behind the curtain. So I started with pure vanilla JS.

## Todo
- [ ] Improve Error handling
- [ ] Implement more common/most used 'async' collections
- [ ] More useful functions using ES6's async/await
